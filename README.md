# hello-world
One more step up the mountain.
Figured this was an apt medaphore for the start of this journey.
You can't see the top through the trees. 
All you know is you have to head upward to make progress.
Sometimes you will hit blocks or cliffs and have to go down or sidehill to get around them that is ok.
Pace yourself it is not a sprint.
